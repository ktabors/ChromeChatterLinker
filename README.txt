Chatter Linker
A Chrome extension for Salesforce.com's Chatter that makes sharing links easy and notifies the user of followers chatter.

Kyle Taborski

This was created for a demo and is therefore not a complete extension. It was developed prior to the release of chatter.

To get it to work edit both the background.html and popup.html to have your Salesforce.com's username, password, and security token. You'll also need to customize the URL in popup.html for the home link.

Areas in need of immediate improvement:
- Fix the math related to the getting followers chatter in the last hour.
- Add an options page for entering username, password, security token, and customizable URL.

Nice features to add:
- Allow the user to define the time period for follower chatter.
- Show any company chatter about the link you're about to share.
- Define state for the chatter count, something like all chatter since opening, last time the home link was clicked, or last time the home URL was visited.
